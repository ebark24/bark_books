## Overview

**Project Title**: Bark Books

**Project Description**: A mobile/web app that can help buissness keep track of thier revenues and expenses. The user can input transactions and then records them and then can complie them based on category so that finanical statements can esily be made.

**Project Goals**: I want to take more time to study before I get into the project. After taking the time to study the nessecary elements I will then approach teh project. I also hope to understand flutter/dart in a deeper way so that I can apply it into our team project.
